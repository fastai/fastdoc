The third line tells fastai what kind of dataset we have, and how it is
structured. There are various different classes for different kinds of
deep learning dataset and problem–here we're using
`ImageDataLoaders`. The first part of the class name will generally be
the type of data you have, such as image, or text. The second part will
generally be the type of problem you are solving, such as
classification, or regression.

The other important piece of information that we have to tell fastai is
how to get the labels from the dataset. Computer vision datasets are
normally structured in such a way that the label for an image is part of
the file name, or path, most commonly the parent folder name. Fastai
comes with a number of standardized labelling methods, and ways to write
your own. Here we define a function `is_cat` which labels cats based on
a filename rule provided by the dataset creators.

Finally, we define the `Transform`s that we need. A `Transform` contains
code that is applied automatically during training; fastai includes many
pre-defined `Transform`s, and adding new ones is as simple as creating a
Python function. There are two kinds: `item_tfms` are applied to each
item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224 pixel square);
`batch_tfms` are applied to a _batch_ of items at a time using the GPU,
so they're particularly fast (we'll see many
examples of these throughout this book).

Why 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old
pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty
much anything. If you increase the size, you'll often get a
model with better results (since it will be able to focus on more
details) but at the price of speed and memory consumption; or visa versa
if you decrease the size.

....
This should be fine
....

In this case, there's an extremely convenient mathematical
operation that calculates `w*x` for every row of a
matrix–it's called _matrix multiplication_.

This notebook shows all the special syntax to use to write the book.

== Inputs and outputs

By default inputs and outputs of each code cell are shown (except
widgets).

You can use the hide input extension to hide an input…

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>This</td>
      <td>is</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>an</td>
      <td>example</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>of</td>
      <td>table</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
++++

Or you can flag it with `#hide_input`

<table border="1" class="dataframe">

== Formatting

`backward quotes`, 'single quotes' and "double
quotes" are all left as is. Note that in asciidoc, text in single
quotes is emphasized.

This is a bullet list. It absolutely needs a new line before beginning.

* one item
* two items

This is a numbered list. It also needs a new line.

. first
. second

This is the syntax for a labeled list (don't forget the new
line):

Term 1::
  Definition/description
Term 2::
  lila

Alternatively, we can write in asciidoc:

Term 1::
  Definition/description
Term 2::
  lila

Block quotes supported by O'Reilly:

This is a warning. Caution gives the same rendering.

[NOTE]

This is a note.

[TIP]

This is a tip. Important gives the same rendering.

For a traditional block quote, you still need to put a column for
correct rendering.

____
The inside of block quotes is not converted so we need to use asciidoc syntax inside.
____


You can define a sidebar with title like this:


.My intervention
****

This will be changed to a sidebar when converted in Asciidoc.

It can have several lines, contrary to a block quote.

Here as well you need to use asciidoc syntax.
****


Another way to have sidebars is to delimit it between headers cells like
this (headers need to be in a cell of their own for this to work).


.Another intervention
****


All of this will be inside the sidebar. You use normal markdown syntax
in this block, and can have code cells or images.


****


To write directly in asciidoc, you can use a raw cell or a triple quote
enviromnent flagged with `asciidoc`

This is a raw cell. Things inside are not interpreted.

To add a caption and a reference to an output table, use `#id` and
`#caption` flags

For images in markdown, use the HTML syntax. Fields alt, width, caption
and id are all interpreted properly.

[[puppy]]
.This is an image
image::puppy.jpg["Alternative text", 420]


Use `<< >>` for references (asciidoc syntax). This is a reference
to the puppy in <<puppy>> before.

To add a label, caption, alternative text or width to an image output,
use the following flags

[source, python]

from fastai.vision.all import *
path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)
fnames = get_image_files(path/'images')
PILImage.create(fnames[0])
